# Layoff Data Cleaning and Exploration (using MySQL)

This repository documents a project exploring a dataset of global layoffs. The project follows two key phases:

## 1. Data Cleaning:

- Utilized MySQL queries to clean and pre-process the data, ensuring its accuracy and consistency for further analysis.
- Implemented techniques such as removing duplicates, standardizing data formats (e.g., dates, job titles), and handling missing values using appropriate methods (e.g., deletion, imputation).
- Included code snippets and explanations to demonstrate the applied data cleaning procedures.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Leveraged SQL queries to explore trends and patterns within the cleaned data.
- Analyzed aspects like:
   - Identifying industries most affected by layoffs.
   - Investigating temporal patterns in layoffs (e.g., seasonal trends).
   - Exploring other relevant factors contributing to layoffs (if available in the data).

## Tools:

- MySQL
- SQL

The cleaned data is prepared for further exploration and potential use in predictive modeling or other data science applications.
